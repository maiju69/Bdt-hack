## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

      ### Running the App
      1. Clone this repository:
         ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/maiju69/hgzy-prediction-app.git
               cd hgzy-prediction-app
                  ```
                  2. Execute the main script:
                     ```bash
                        python src/app.py
                           ```

                           ---

                           ## How It Works
                           1. **Data Collection**: The app collects historical data from the HGZY platform.
                           2. **Data Processing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.
                           3. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained on the processed data.
                           4. **Prediction**: The model predicts future outcomes based on patterns in the data.
